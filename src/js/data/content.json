I published an article series on the <a href='https://hackernoon.com/a-tale-of-javascript-performance-61c282f89f2a' target='_blank'>making of HeapViz</a>. Chrome heap profiles are very large, and I needed to use all of the performance-enhancing tools at my disposal to effectively render them, including <strong>WebGL</strong>, <strong>WebAssembly</strong>, and <strong>WebWorkers</strong>. Building HeapViz has been the challenge of my career, but I have learned and grown an incredible amount from the experienve.</p>",
